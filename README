voice shifter
=============

Shifts someone's voice to make them sound older/younger/manlier/vice versa.

Emits the pitch-adjusted stream live as a PulseAudio sink
(i.e. a virtual microphone) so Linux users can do stuff like:

Speak into microphone --> voice shifter transforms stream --> virtual
microphone.

And speak in games etc with a different voice.

The virtual microphone with the altered voice appears in the PulseAudio
control panel as "null output". There are some outstanding issues with latency
which might be fixable: I haven't dedicated a lot of time to figuring this
out.

Dependencies:
-------------

This is just a frontend to some obscure PulseAudio functions and sox:

pulseaudio pavucontrol sox libsox3 libsox-fmt-pulse

and implicitly Linux. :) (Not tested on FreeBSD etc.)
